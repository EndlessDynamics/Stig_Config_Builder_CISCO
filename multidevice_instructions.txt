## Your Multi-Device CSV File: ##
#################################

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
 + must contain data for 2 or more devices.
 + must contain a value for EVERY column listed below.
 + must NOT contain any column headers.
 + must NOT have any spaces between the double quotes and commas.
 + must NOT have any whitespace before the first, or after the last, quoted value in each line.
 + must NOT have any empty lines/spaces before the first line, or after the last line, of field values.
 + must NOT add or remove any fields from the 30 fields shown below.
 + must use a single comma to separate the values.
 + must use double quotes to wrap any value that contains a comma. (Values in csv files are separated by commas, using double quotes to encapsulate values that contain commas themselves prevents errors when parsing for values.
 + Notice in the section below titled 'Field Options', some Fields are denoted with: [Choose one]. The option you select must MATCH EXACTLY to one of the available options. Values ARE CASE-SENSITIVE.

FIELD OPTION VALUES:
 + Each comma-separated value represents a data entry for its corresponding FIELD. 
    i.e.  The following represents the first 3 values for a row of device data: "OOB","Switch_Nexus","DC-CORE-SW1"
          "DC-CORE-SW1" would be associated to the variable 'devName'.

HINTS - HOW TO GENERATE A MULTI-DEVICE CSV FILE:
 + Create your file in notepad, and save it with a .csv filetype extension(NOT the default of .txt).
 + View the sample data from an example csv file at the bottom of these instructions if you have any questions.
